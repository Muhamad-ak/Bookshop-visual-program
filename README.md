The project proposal emanated from one of the team members, delineating the 
creation of a sophisticated system designed for the purpose of facilitating book 
sales within a bookstore setting. 
System Definition: This intricate system is devised to grant administrative access, 
requiring the input of a specific username and password combination through a 
secure login portal. Upon successful authentication, the administrator gains access 
to a comprehensive Books page.

On this page, the administrator can seamlessly incorporate new books into the 
system by populating requisite fields, including Book Title, Author, Categories, 
Quantity, and Price. Following this data entry, the administrator simply activates 
the Save button, triggering an automatic update of the book inventory. The newly 
added book is instantaneously reflected in the system.
